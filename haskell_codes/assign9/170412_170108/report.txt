-------------------Substitution Ciphers-------------------
(solved by Aniket Gupta(170108) and Naman Gupta(170412))

There are two types of ciphers : One which take set off symbols present in cipher as an array and the
other which assumes that the letters are mapped amongst themselves.

To solve these cipher we apply following algorithm:
i) First we sort charcters according to their frequency, and map them to english letters as per the frequency of english alphabets.
ii) Now we start swapping two symbols randomly and if the number of matches with dictionary is more we keep this swapped array otherwise keep working with the older array.
iii) We repeat step (ii) about 100-500 times.
iv)substition array at the end of step (iii) is our solution.

Heurestics Used:
i) We tried swapping in a given range but swapping in range (1,6) gave best results also we similarly found an appropriate range of the index to be swapped.
