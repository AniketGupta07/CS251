For fibonnaci :
We used iterative method. 
fib_temp takes 4 argument where c is the counter denoting which fibonnacci is currently calculated
a and b denotes Fc and Fc-1

For prime:
modu n return all elements in 2<i<n-1 which divide n 
isprime n function checks if 'n' is prime or not by checking the length of array returned by modu n.
inf is the infinite array of all primes made by checking each element by function isprime.
prime n function simply returns nth prime from the inf array.
