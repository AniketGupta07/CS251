Firstly ./create_asgn was executed which created a directory asgn.

Then directory was changed to asgn but on using ls it showed permission denied.
On executing la in the pevious directory it showed that the owner didn't had the
 reading permissions. So by executing 'chmod 711 asgn' read permissions was give
n to asgn directory.

Then ther was an executable run_me in the asgn dir.uppon executing './run_me' it
 again showed permission denied. Upon executing la it showed that there was a sy
mlink from run_me to bin/.run_me.
Then on changing the directory to bin and executing 'la' it showed that executin
g permissions were not given. So on executing 'chmod 744 .run_me' execution perm
issions wereprovided to the file.

Now going back to the previous directory and executing './run_me' it gave an err
or telling that directory outout doesn't exist.
So directory output was created by running 'mkdir output' and again runnig run_m
e code.html was obtained from output directory
